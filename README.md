Thanks to:

TheFlyBandit for the (Black & White) Theme Postal Map (https://forum.cfx.re/t/free-minimap-noir-black-white-theme-postal-map/5238128)

@ ItzGoatATL#3199 for the Baltimore and Philly minimap edit!

YBN for the Baltimore and Philly Map! (https://discord.gg/AYfUYWtbJM)

Add our file to your Resources and ensure it in your Server CFG:

ensure BHS_PostalMap

This file has the /postal script as well as streams the mini map all in one resource!

In the city, if you do /postal and type in any postal, then press enter, it will draw a light blue waypoint to that postal!

V2 will have street names and postals for Baltimore and Philly.

A BHS Edit!
